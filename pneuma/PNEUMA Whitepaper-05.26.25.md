## 1. Introduction

### Name Origin

The name **PNEUMA** comes from the Greek word _pneuma_ (πνεῦμα), which translates to **Spirit**, **Breath**, or **Wind**. This word appears throughout the New Testament to describe the Holy Spirit — the animating force of God that indwells and empowers believers. Its Old Testament counterpart in Hebrew is **Ruach** (רוּחַ), which carries the same meaning of **wind** or **breath**, signifying the invisible yet powerful presence of God.

> "By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and by the breath (_ruach_) of his mouth all their host." — _Psalm 33:6_

> "Then he said to me, 'Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord GOD: Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.'" — _Ezekiel 37:9_

> "The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit (_pneuma_)." — _John 3:8_

> "The Spirit (_pneuma_) himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God." — _Romans 8:16_

> "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control..." — _Galatians 5:22–23_

The use of "PNEUMA" reflects the project's spiritual mission to carry the breath of God — His presence and His message — across nations, igniting life and transformation.

---

### Foundation

PNEUMA is firmly grounded in the Word of God, driven by a biblical vision of **stewardship**, **multiplication**, and **faithful service**. The parable of the talents (Matthew 25:14–30) teaches that the resources given by God are meant to be used fruitfully for His Kingdom. PNEUMA reflects this principle by turning digital currency into a channel for Kingdom investment.

> "For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property..." — _Matthew 25:14–30_

Believers are not passive recipients of grace but active agents of the Gospel. This crypto project invites every holder to become a **steward**, not merely an investor — using the coin to fuel missions, support evangelism, and embody the Spirit-led generosity found in the early church.

---

### Overview

PNEUMA is a deflationary cryptocurrency launched on the Stellar blockchain with a distinct mission: to enable real-world ministry through Spirit-filled finance. It is:

- **Kingdom-Based**: Centered around advancing the Gospel through measurable discipleship and evangelism.
    
- **Deflationary**: Modeled after the scarcity of Bitcoin, capped forever at 144,000 tokens, symbolizing a complete and holy remnant (cf. Revelation 14:1).
    
- **Faith-Rooted**: Designed to serve ministries, not markets. A portion of each transaction is redirected to vetted Zambian-based ministries.
    

PNEUMA is part of the broader **Project Pneuma infrastructure**, which includes the Vessel App, CIMCO (a public utility coin), and the future SODE governance token. PNEUMA itself is **not available for public trading** and is exclusively reserved as a **reward for verified ministry activity** documented through the Vessel App.

The project is birthed out of the desire of Carrier Inspiration Ministries to strengthen the relationship in the church between the **United States and Zambia**, linking two parts of the global Church to fulfill the call of the Great Commission:

> "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit..." — _Matthew 28:19–20_

This token does not simply represent financial value — it represents **a breath of Kingdom purpose**. Every transaction is a movement of the Spirit, a ripple of obedience, and a small echo of the breath that brings life.

---
## 2. Purpose

### Mission Statement

PNEUMA empowers and is empowered by gospel movement through borderless, Spirit-led transactions that are rooted in both faith and finance. Its purpose is not merely to create an alternative currency, but to manifest a new economy — one where the work of ministry is both funded and fueled by the flow of generosity and the power of the Holy Spirit.

> "For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God." — _2 Corinthians 9:12_

The mission of PNEUMA is fundamentally spiritual: to breathe life into dormant or underfunded ministry work and extend the reach of the Church through a practical tool for Kingdom action. It is a reserved tool used only in response to confirmed ministry engagement.

### Vision

The ultimate vision of PNEUMA is that:

- The Great Commission would be **fulfilled**.
    
- Ministry work would be **funded** consistently, transparently, and Spirit-led.
    
- Discipleship and evangelism would be **measured** and **motivated** through on-chain activity and progress-tracking mechanisms.
    
- Financial participation would be spiritually transformative, aligning believers’ wallets with their witness.
    

In this vision, each unit of PNEUMA — down to its smallest fraction 1/7th of a PNEUMA, the _Grain_ — is not a speculative asset, but a seed sown in faith.

> "Whoever sows generously will also reap generously." — _2 Corinthians 9:6_

---
## 3. Use Cases

PNEUMA is a mission-based reward token used exclusively within the **Project Pneuma infrastructure**. While not publicly tradable on the open market, PNEUMA is designed to be exchangeable with **CIMCO** through the **Vessel App**, which will function both as a wallet and a streamlined exchange interface.

The system includes:

- **The Vessel App** for logging ministry activity, holding tokens, and facilitating internal exchange.
    
- **CIMCO**, the market-facing coin that users can trade more broadly.
    
- **SODE**, a governance token given to ministry workers with no market value and a 2-year halflife (not yet released).
    

These use cases describe how PNEUMA is practically applied by users, ministry workers, and organizations.

### 1. **Earn PNEUMA for Ministry Work**

Log discipleship, evangelism, or ministry activity in the Vessel App. After review, verified actions will earn PNEUMA tokens. This is the only way to receive PNEUMA.

### 2. **Regional Ministry Support**

10% of PNEUMA total supply as well as 10% of the CIMCO total supply is allocated to Zambian-based ministries. These are distributed manually by Carrier Inspiration Ministries to known and active partners.

### 3. **Encouragement for Frontline Workers**

Each PNEUMA token given is a way of saying, “we see you.” It offers encouragement, recognition, and motivation to keep going.

### 4. **Future Participation in Governance (via SODE)**

Ministry workers who receive PNEUMA consistently may be granted **SODE tokens** in the future. These allow participation in project governance but cannot be traded or sold.

### 5. **Measure Gospel Progress**

Each verified action logged in the Vessel App is recorded and tallied. As tokens are distributed, they also serve as a measure of real-world gospel progress.

### 6. **Support Ministry Projects**

Users can send PNEUMA to ministry partners directly using their Stellar wallet or through the Vessel App. Each transaction is trackable and transparent.

### 7. **Low-Barrier Participation**

There is no minimum to get involved. Even tiny amounts (a "Grain" of PNEUMA) can be sent. This makes participation easy, especially in lower-income areas.

### 8. **Globally Accessible**

Anyone can send or receive PNEUMA worldwide using a Stellar wallet like LOBSTR or directly within the Vessel App. There are no banks or paperwork required.

### 9. **Designed for Spirit-Led Giving**

Giving with PNEUMA isn’t automated or impulsive — it’s led by prayer, intent, and community. Each transaction is purposeful.

### 10. **Planned Offline Functionality**

As the Vessel App evolves, users will be able to log ministry work without internet and sync it later. This allows usage in remote regions.

### 11. **Future Smart Features**

PNEUMA will eventually be auto-connected to certain events in the Vessel App (e.g., training completed, outreach completed), which will allow automatic token rewards once verified.

## 4. Narrative

This project began with a simple act of obedience — one relationship that opened the door to many more. Bryce Nathanial Carrier, an American missionary, traveled to Zambia in 2024 through The Vineyard Church for what was meant to be a short-term mission. But as often happens when the Spirit leads, the plans changed. By May 2025, he was still there — living, learning, and listening.

The challenges he encountered weren’t just personal. As he tried to support local churches and ministries, he ran into a major hurdle: limited access to effective financial systems. Moving funds between the U.S. and Zambia was unreliable, expensive, and at times, impossible. This wasn’t just Bryce’s problem. It was the lived reality of many faithful, hardworking believers on the ground.

That realization birthed **Project Pneuma**. Not a startup. Not a crypto gimmick. A Spirit-led infrastructure designed to support ministry, empower local leaders, and provide a system where faithful action could be met with faithful provision.

PNEUMA is the cornerstone reward token in this infrastructure — not for buying and selling, but for doing the work of the Kingdom. It is earned through the **Vessel App** by logging real ministry work: preaching, discipling, serving. It is given as a response to action, not speculation.

But Bryce knew this needed to go further. Some people need flexibility to participate in a digital economy. That’s where **CIMCO** comes in — the tradable, market-facing counterpart to PNEUMA. CIMCO allows for movement and exchange while preserving the spiritual purpose of PNEUMA.

And to keep everything aligned with long-term purpose, there is **SODE** — a governance token for decision-making by those actively working in ministry. SODE ensures that those doing the work are also helping shape the direction.

> "Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul... they had everything in common." — _Acts 4:32–35_

PNEUMA is not a tool for getting rich. It’s a tool for getting real work done. It enables transparency, encouragement, and mutual support for gospel workers across borders. Especially in places like Zambia, where the Church is vibrant, the faith is strong, and the infrastructure is thin.

More than anything, this project is about **vessels** — ordinary people filled with the Spirit, carrying something greater than themselves. That’s where the name comes from: "PNEUMA," the Greek word for breath, spirit, or wind.

> "But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us." — _2 Corinthians 4:7_

This is not the mission itself. It’s just a tool. But it’s a tool that can help real people do real ministry. And that’s why it was created: so it can continue making a difference until the whole earth hears.

## 6. Tokenomics

The tokenomics of PNEUMA have been intentionally designed to support long-term stability, spiritual alignment, and real-world ministry application within the larger **Project Pneuma Infrastructure**.

### Total Supply

- **Maximum Supply:** 144,000 PNEUMA tokens
    
- **Reference:** Revelation 14:1 — symbolic of completeness and faithful witness
    
- **Supply Cap:** Fixed; no future minting will occur beyond this number
    

### Circulation

- **Initial Circulation:** 10,000 PNEUMA + 14,400 PNEUMA set aside for 72 Zambian-Based Ministries
    
- **Current Status:** Tokens held in a distribution wallet for manual allocation during onboarding and early adoption
    

### Divisibility

- **Decimal Precision:** 7 decimal places (0.0000001)
    
- **Smallest Unit:** Referred to as a **Grain**
    
    - **Reference:** Matthew 17:20 — "If you have faith as small as a grain..."
        
- **Rationale:** Allows for microtransactions and symbolic alignment with scriptural metaphors of faith and sowing
    

### Deflationary Model

- **Design Inspiration:** Modeled after Bitcoin's scarcity and capped supply principles
    
- **No Inflation:** Additional tokens cannot be minted once the supply cap is reached
    
- **Release Structure:** Coin distribution over time will be slow and tied to real-world, mission-driven events and participation divided over 13 phases. The Last phase indicating the the fulfillment of The Great Commission according to Scripture.  
      
>“And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.”––_Matthew 24:14
    
>“And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations.”––*Mark 13:10*
    

Mark 13:10)

- **Underlying Logic:** Ministry effort serves as a form of "proof of work" through the **Vessel App**, which is the only authorized pathway to earn new PNEUMA tokens. This is mean to simulate staggered release overtime, and imitate Bitcoin's "Proof-of-Work" where the "work" is real-world gospel work in real-time. 
    

PNEUMA is not designed for public trading or market speculation. Instead, its internal value is realized when exchanged for **CIMCO**, the project’s market-facing token. CIMCO serves to bridge external demand and internal mission by offering liquidity and tradability to users, while keeping PNEUMA reserved strictly for ministry impact.

Additionally, **SODE** tokens — future governance tokens with a 2-year halflife and market value, and programmed with an inability to be traded — will be granted to active ministry participants as the network grows. These tokens will decentralize decision-making authority and bring governance closer to those living out the Gospel in real time in alignment with Jesus teaching, "

>“And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, ‘If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all.’”––*Mark 9:35*

>“The greatest among you shall be your servant.”––*Matthew 23:11*

>“But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”––*Matthew 20:26-28*

>“But not so with you. Rather, let the greatest among you become as the youngest, and the leader as one who serves. For who is the greater, one who reclines at table or one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at table? But I am among you as the one who serves.”––*Luke 22:26-27*

    - Log gospel-driven activities
        
    - Receive PNEUMA rewards
        
    - Exchange PNEUMA for CIMCO within the app interface
        
    - Track personal and collective ministry milestones
        
    - Act as a social network to openly see ministry workers activity
        
    - Join in on live discipleship and evangelical ministry activities. 
        
- **Strategic Partnerships:**
    
    - Building relationships with gospel ministries, blockchain developers, and investors such as established missions organizations or crypto exchanges to streamline the CIMCO/PNEUMA 
        
- **Support Documentation:** Ongoing development of key technical and strategic documentation:
    
    - **Phase Release Document:** Detailed explanation of the 13-phase coin distribution model
        
    - **Gospel Metrics Tracking Framework:** A framework for tying token issuance to measurable discipleship and evangelism metrics
        

### Long-Term Vision

- **Mission Alignment:** All token releases will remain tied to verified ministry activity recorded through the Vessel App
    
- **Geographic Anchoring:** Progress will be linked to the reach of the Gospel into specific regions
    
- **Supply Completion:** The fixed supply of 144,000 PNEUMA will be distributed only as global gospel advancement milestones are fulfilled; the last stage milestones are meant to reflect the completion of The 
    

> "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..." — *Matthew 28:19–20*

> "And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." — *Matthew 24:14*

### Supporting Infrastructure

This roadmap is embedded in the broader vision of **Project Pneuma**, which also includes:

- **VESSEL:** A decentralized application and ministry engagement tool that acts as both a wallet and a logging platform. VESSEL enables users to log verified ministry actions, receive PNEUMA as a reward, exchange it for CIMCO, and participate in a ministry-based social, evangelistic and discipleship network in the real-world in real-time.
    
- **CIMCO:** Tradable token used to bridge the gap between internal ministry rewards and external financial value
    
- **SODE:** Governance tokens with no market value, granted to ministry workers and holders of PNEUMA, designed to decay over time to ensure ongoing participation
    

All project timelines, release schedules, and evaluation criteria will remain flexible and Spirit-led, while rooted in measurable, scripturally-aligned Kingdom progress.

Further documentation will be maintained and regularly updated at: [https://www.github.com/pneumacoin/pneumacoin.github.io](https://www.github.com/pneumacoin/pneumacoin.github.io)
