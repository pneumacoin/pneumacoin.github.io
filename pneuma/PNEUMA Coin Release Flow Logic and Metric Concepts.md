## PNEUMA Coin Release Flow Logic and Metric Concepts-05.26.25

This document outlines the phased release structure of the PNEUMA token, guided by a **Three-Layered Kingdom Accountability Framework**. This framework ties token distribution directly to measurable spiritual progress — ensuring that the release of value mirrors the spread of the Gospel.

### Release Flow Logic

**Discipleship → Evangelism → Global Gospel Completion → Token Release**

Each layer must be verified before the next one activates. This safeguards against progress without spiritual depth and ensures that the mission drives the economy — not the reverse.

Failsafes will be further developed to ensure:

- Evangelism is not counted without underlying discipleship structure
    
- Discipleship growth is accompanied by active outreach
    
- Incentive loops support long-term faithfulness, not just numerical output

While Scripture identifies **five primary ministry roles** —

- **Apostles**
    
- **Prophets**
    
- **Evangelists**
    
- **Pastors (Shepherds)**
    
- **Teachers**
    

> _"And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ..."_ — _Ephesians 4:11–12_

—this framework simplifies their collective activity into two functional outcomes:

- **Evangelism:** Building the **number** of disciples
    
- **Discipleship:** Building the **quality** of disciples
    

Every act of ministry ultimately contributes to one or both of these two outcomes. For practical and measurable implementation, the system tracks all ministry activity through these two lenses. This allows for clear accountability while still honoring the unique gifts and callings within the Body of Christ.

### Layer 1: Discipleship Measurements (Spiritual Infrastructure)

> "Go therefore and make disciples..." — _Matthew 28:19_

**Metrics:**

- Number of discipleship groups formed
    
- Active mentor-disciple relationships
    
- 5-Fold Ministry representation across regions
    
- Scripture literacy milestones
    
- Baptism records showing progressive growth
    

**Tools:**

- In-app discipleship logs (Vessel app)
    
- Reporting from church partners
    
- Peer verification (e.g., 2–3 witnesses per group)
    

**Token Effect:**

- Evangelism-related token releases are only triggered once minimum discipleship thresholds are met.
    

### Conclusion

The PNEUMA Release Phases are intentionally structured to mirror the natural flow of the Great Commission. Discipleship lays the foundation, evangelism builds the reach, and global gospel coverage completes the vision.

**Release Flow Logic:**  
**Discipleship → Evangelism → Global Gospel Completion → Token Release**

Each stage must be verified before the next activates. This guards against mechanical performance without spiritual depth. It ensures the mission drives the economy — never the other way around.

**Failsafe Safeguards:**

- Evangelism efforts must be grounded in established discipleship infrastructure
    
- Discipleship must result in outward-reaching gospel proclamation
    
- The system rewards sustained, faithful ministry — not just numerical output or short-term metrics
    

This model remains flexible in application but firm in conviction: PNEUMA is more than a token — it’s a tool built to serve the mission of God through accountable, Spirit-led action.
