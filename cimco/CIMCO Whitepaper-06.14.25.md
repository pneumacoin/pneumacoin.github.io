# CIMCO Whitepaper - 06.14.25

## 1. Introduction

### Name Origin

The name CIMCO stands for Carrier Inspiration Ministries Coin. It represents the public-facing, market-compatible asset within the broader Project Pneuma Infrastructure, functioning as a bridge between the internal, ministry-oriented PNEUMA token and the broader digital economy.

Where PNEUMA is reserved for ministry work, CIMCO is designed for liquidity, usability, and value creation through favorable trading. It serves as the accessible currency that believers and supporters can exchange, trade, and use in conjunction with Kingdom work.

### Foundation

CIMCO is not just a tradable asset. It is part of a vision to enable sustainable support for global discipleship. It empowers individuals and ministries by providing a gateway to participate in gospel-oriented economic activity while maintaining accountability to purpose and mission.

CIMCO exists to make PNEUMA spendable — turning internal Kingdom effort into real-world provision.

### Overview

CIMCO is a digital token deployed on the Stellar blockchain. It is:

- **Tradable**: Meant to interact with external financial systems and be exchanged openly
- **Value-Building**: Offers pathways for liquidity and long-term value growth through trading and support
- **Bridge Token**: Connects the closed, ministry-rewarded PNEUMA with the open digital marketplace

As part of Project Pneuma, CIMCO is crucial to building a faith-aligned ecosystem where real ministry effort is rewarded and supported with accessible financial tools.

## 2. Purpose

### Mission Statement

CIMCO enables the external usability of internal ministry rewards. While PNEUMA is earned through ministry, CIMCO is the public-facing utility token used to trade, support, and circulate value.

> "Let the one who is taught the word share all good things with the one who teaches." — Galatians 6:6

The aim of CIMCO is to value ministry in a tangible way — allowing supporters to contribute, exchange, and participate in building sustainable systems of spiritual and financial support.

### Vision

- Create a bridge between mission and market
- Empower ministry workers with practical liquidity
- Offer a non-speculative, purpose-driven digital economy
- Lay the groundwork for Kingdom-led impact within the financial world
- Provide a tool to enable intentional, directional shift of value from speculation and world market growth toward Kingdom Work and Kingdom Growth by way of personal choice of each believer.

## 3. Use Cases

CIMCO is designed for use within and beyond the Project Pneuma ecosystem. Its utility grows with adoption and integration.

- **Exchange for PNEUMA via Vessel App**: Users can exchange CIMCO for PNEUMA at values set by active ministry participation and exchange dynamics inside the Vessel App.
- **Trade on StellarTerm**: CIMCO is openly tradable on platforms such as StellarTerm, allowing broader participation and support.
- **Support Frontline Ministries**: Buy CIMCO and donate it to a ministry wallet. It will be used within the Vessel ecosystem or converted to fiat through third-party providers like MoneyGram.
- **Participate in Ecosystem Growth**: CIMCO purchases fund liquidity pools, support onboarding, and resource development — helping to create a circular economy of faith.
- **Transfer Between Wallets**: CIMCO can be sent peer-to-peer with low fees and instant settlement on the Stellar blockchain.
- **Accessible Entry Point**: Unlike PNEUMA, CIMCO can be purchased or earned through exchange. It is the easiest point of access for supporters to join the mission.

## 4. Narrative

The creation of CIMCO was born out of necessity. As PNEUMA was created to reward ministry, a new problem surfaced — how do you turn ministry rewards into usable financial resources?

Bryce Carrier, the founder of Carrier Inspiration Ministries, realized that without a tradable asset, ministry workers would struggle to benefit from their PNEUMA tokens. Enter CIMCO — a coin designed to carry that financial value into the ministerial world without compromising the spiritual foundation, as it is established in its nature and purpose by this Whitepaper.

Just as Project Pneuma began in Zambia, where infrastructure and access were limited, CIMCO provides a way forward. A way to turn action into provision. A way for believers to support ministry with more than prayer — with provision and purpose.

CIMCO doesn't exist to be a meme coin or a speculative gamble. It exists so ministry effort has weight in the world’s economy. It's here to bless, not hype.

## 5. Team

CIMCO, like PNEUMA, is led by:

- **Bryce Nathanial Carrier** — Strategic Vision & Deployment
- **Sarah Carrier** — Spiritual & Cultural Guidance

CIMCO is governed under Carrier Inspiration Ministries until SODE tokens are released to establish governance by active ministry workers.

### Long-Term Vision

- Allow believers globally to support local ministry practically and directly from donor-to-ministry worker.
- Tie long-term CIMCO value to Kingdom impact metrics

## 8. Governance

While PNEUMA is spiritually led and manually governed, CIMCO will eventually follow direction from ministry leaders holding SODE tokens.

These tokens:

- Are earned through ministry (not purchased)
- Have no market value
- Decay at a half-life of 2 years to ensure fresh, active leadership

Until then, governance remains under Carrier Inspiration Ministries and future Advisory Board with a plan for off-ramping to ministry workers after SODE coin release and servant-self governance becomes evident.
