# PNEUMA Whitepaper Outline-05.26.25

## 1. Introduction

- **Name Origin:** "Pneuma" is the Greek word for Spirit or Breath or Wind. Is "Ruach" in the Old Testament Hebrew. It represents the breath of God sent forth. (Psalm 33:6; Ezekiel 37:9; John 3:8; Romans 8:16; Galatians 5:22; Matthew 28:19).
    
- **Foundation:** Rooted in Christian faith and biblical stewardship and the calling of God's mission on believers according to scripture (Matthew 25:14–30).
    
- **Overview:** Designed to be a deflationary crypto token built to be driven by discipleship, evangelism, and kingdom-based action in order to fulfill the great commission. (Matthew 28:19-20)
    

## 2. Purpose

- **Mission Statement:** Empowers and is empowered by gospel movement through borderless, Spirit-led transactions in both faith and finance.
    
- **Use Cases:**
    
    - A token that funds ministries and missionary work while connecting believers globally.
        
    - Acts as a measurement tool, as many metrics for gospel message spread throughout the world will drive further coin issuance. 
        
- **Vision:** That the great commission would be fulfilled, driven by ministry work, funded by this token, and measured by metrics measured through Pneuma.
    

## 3. Narrative

- Born out of a burden for gospel advancement and a desire to mirror biblical stewardship
    
- Created to shift financial focus from profit to purpose, from speculation to Spirit-filled acts (Acts 4:32–35)
    
- Inspired by the concept of being vessels for God’s Spirit (2 Corinthians 4:7)

- Why this is starting as a relationship builder between the United States and Zambia
    

## 4. Team

- Faith-driven individuals operating under Carrier Inspiration Ministries.
    
- Partnership between American and Zambian believers.
    
- Accountable leadership walking in the qualifications found in 1 Timothy 3.
    

## 5. Tokenomics

- **Total Supply:** Capped at 144,000 PNEUMA tokens (Revelation 14:1).
    
- **Initial Circulation:** 1,000 PNEUMA currently in distribution.
    
- **Divisibility:** Each PNEUMA divisible to the 7th decimal (Luke 16:10).
    
    - The smallest unit (0.0000001) is called a **Grain**, referencing Matthew 17:20: "If you have faith as small as a grain..."
        
- **Deflationary Model:** Inspired by Bitcoin’s scarcity model; no additional tokens will be created beyond 144,000. Mimicked by slow release of coins in accordance with real world "proof of work" similar to Bitcoin's scarcity and deflation mechanisms.
    
- **Transaction Tithe:** 1% of every transaction is automatically redirected to vetted Zambian ministries (2 Corinthians 9:10–12).
    

## 6. Roadmap

- **Current Phase:** Token creation, early distribution, wallet onboarding.
    
- **Future Development:** App integration (Vessel), strategic partnerships, and support documents on phases and metrics.
    
- **Long-term Vision:** The Great Commission is fulfilled. Real-world discipleship and Evangelism events in real world geography triggers kingdom-oriented token issuance. The Total Cap being 144,000 (Matthew 28:19–20).
